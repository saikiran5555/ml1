    "Neural network architectures used for unsupervised learning, particularly for dimensionality reduction and anomaly detection.\n",
    "Isolation Forest:\n",
    "\n",
    "An algorithm designed for anomaly detection by isolating anomalies more quickly in a tree structure.\n",
    "One-Class SVM (Support Vector Machine):\n",
    "\n",
    "Learns the distribution of normal data and identifies anomalies based on deviations from this distribution.\n",
