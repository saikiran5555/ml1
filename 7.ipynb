    "Unsupervised learning is commonly used in anomaly detection because it can identify patterns and structures within data without relying on labeled examples of anomalies. Here's how unsupervised learning can be applied to anomaly detection:\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering:\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning algorithms, such as k-means clustering or hierarchical clustering, can group similar data points together. Anomalies may form their own clusters or be isolated points, making them stand out from the normal patterns.\n",
    "Density-Based Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithms like DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) can identify areas of higher data density. Outliers or anomalies are often located in less dense regions, and density-based methods can effectively detect such deviations.\n",
    "Isolation Forest:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Isolation Forest algorithm is an unsupervised learning approach specifically designed for anomaly detection. It works by isolating anomalies more quickly than normal instances in a tree structure.\n",
    "Autoencoders:\n",
    "\n",
    "Autoencoders, a type of neural network, can be trained to reconstruct input data. During training, the model learns to represent the normal patterns in the data. Anomalies may result in higher reconstruction errors, making them stand out.\n",
    "One-Class SVM (Support Vector Machine):\n",
    "\n",
    "One-Class SVM is an algorithm that learns the distribution of normal data and identifies anomalies as instances that deviate from this learned distribution. It is particularly useful when normal data is expected to occupy a specific region in the feature space.\n",
    "Principal Component Analysis (PCA):\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that can be used for anomaly detection. Anomalies may be detected in the reduced-dimensional space, as they often result in significant variations from the majority of data.\n",
    "Local Outlier Factor (LOF):\n",
    "\n",
    "LOF is a method that computes the local density deviation of a data point concerning its neighbors. Anomalies are often less dense and have higher LOF scores.\n",
    "Workflow for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Exploration:\n",
    "\n",
    "Understand the distribution of normal data and identify potential features that differentiate anomalies.\n",
    "Feature Engineering:\n",
    "\n",
    "Select or engineer features that capture relevant information for anomaly detection.\n",
    "Model Training:\n",
    "\n",
    "Apply unsupervised learning algorithms (e.g., clustering, density-based methods) to the normal data.\n",
    "Anomaly Detection:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the trained model to identify instances that deviate from the learned normal patterns. These instances are considered anomalies.\n",
    "Evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluate the model's performance using additional labeled data if available or using domain knowledge to assess the relevance of identified anomalies."
