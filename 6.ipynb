    "In machine learning, the terms \"train set,\" \"test set,\" and \"validation set\" refer to different subsets of a dataset, and each serves a specific purpose in training and evaluating a machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training Set:\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: The training set is a subset of the dataset used to train the machine learning model. It contains examples with both input features and their corresponding correct output labels.\n",
    "Purpose: The model learns from the patterns and relationships present in the training set. The goal is to enable the model to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.\n",
    "Test Set:\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: The test set is a separate subset of the dataset that is not used during the training phase. It also contains examples with input features and their corresponding correct output labels.\n",
    "Purpose: The test set is reserved to evaluate the performance of the trained model. By assessing the model's predictions on this unseen data, you can estimate how well the model is likely to generalize to new, real-world data.\n",
    "Validation Set:\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: The validation set is an additional subset of the dataset that is not used during the training phase. Like the test set, it contains examples with input features and output labels.\n",
    "Purpose: The validation set is used during the training process to fine-tune model parameters and prevent overfitting. It helps assess the model's performance on data that it hasn't seen before without contaminating the test set."
