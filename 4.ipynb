    "Artificial Intelligence (AI):\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: AI refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. It encompasses a wide range of techniques and approaches to enable machines to simulate human-like cognition.\n",
    "Scope: AI is a broad field that includes both narrow AI, where systems are designed for a specific task, and general AI, where systems can perform any intellectual task that a human can.\n",
    "Machine Learning (ML):\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: ML is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from data. Instead of being explicitly programmed, machines learn patterns and make decisions based on examples.\n",
    "Scope: ML includes various techniques such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. It is used for tasks like classification, regression, clustering, and pattern recognition.\n",
    "Deep Learning (DL):\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: DL is a specialized subset of ML that involves neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks). These networks can automatically learn hierarchical representations of data.\n",
    "Scope: DL is particularly effective for tasks like image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and other complex pattern recognition problems. It has shown significant success in handling large amounts of unstructured data.\n",
    "Data Science (DS):\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: DS is a multidisciplinary field that combines techniques from statistics, mathematics, and computer science to extract insights and knowledge from data. It involves data collection, cleaning, analysis, and interpretation.\n",
    "Scope: DS covers a wide range of activities, including data exploration, feature engineering, statistical modeling, machine learning, and the communication of findings. It plays a crucial role in informing business decisions and solving complex problems."
